<H2>CHAPTER 5: Pointers and Structures </H2>
<P>
As you may know, we can declare the form of a block of data containing
different data types by means of a structure declaration. For
example, a personnel file might contain structures which look
something like: 
<PRE>
    struct tag {
        char lname[20];        /* last name */
        char fname[20];        /* first name */
        int age;               /* age */
        float rate;            /* e.g. 12.75 per hour */
    };
</PRE>
<P>
Let's say we have a bunch of these structures in a disk file and
we want to read each one out and print out the first and last
name of each one so that we can have a list of the people in our
files. The remaining information will not be printed out. We will
want to do this printing with a function call and pass to that
function a pointer to the structure at hand. For demonstration
purposes I will use only one structure for now. But realize the
goal is the writing of the function, not the reading of the file
which, presumably, we know how to do. 
<P>
For review, recall that we can access structure members with the
dot operator as in: 
<PRE>
--------------- program 5.1 ------------------

/* Program 5.1 from PTRTUT10.HTM     6/13/97 */


#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct tag {
    char lname[20];      /* last name */
    char fname[20];      /* first name */
    int age;             /* age */
    float rate;          /* e.g. 12.75 per hour */
};

struct tag my_struct;       /* declare the structure my_struct */

int main(void)
{
    strcpy(my_struct.lname,&quot;Jensen&quot;);
    strcpy(my_struct.fname,&quot;Ted&quot;);
    printf(&quot;\n%s &quot;,my_struct.fname);
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,my_struct.lname);
    return 0;
}

-------------- end of program 5.1 --------------
</PRE>
<P>
Now, this particular structure is rather small compared to many
used in C programs. To the above we might want to add: 
<PRE>
    date_of_hire;                  (data types not shown)
    date_of_last_raise;
    last_percent_increase;
    emergency_phone;
    medical_plan;
    Social_S_Nbr;
    etc.....
</PRE>
<P>
If we have a large number of employees, what we want to do is
manipulate the data in these structures by means of functions.
For example we might want a function print out the name of the
employee listed in any structure passed to it. However, in the
original C (Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, 1st Edition) it was not possible
to pass a structure, only a pointer to a structure could be passed.
In ANSI C, it is now permissible to pass the complete structure.
But, since our goal here is to learn more about pointers, we won't
pursue that. 
<P>
Anyway, if we pass the whole structure it means that we must copy
the contents of the structure from the calling function to the
called function. In systems using stacks, this is done by pushing
the contents of the structure on the stack. With large structures
this could prove to be a problem. However, passing a pointer uses
a minimum amount of stack space. 
<P>
In any case, since this is a discussion of pointers, we will discuss
how we go about passing a pointer to a structure and then using
it within the function. 
<P>
Consider the case described, i.e. we want a function that will
accept as a parameter a pointer to a structure and from within
that function we want to access members of the structure. For
example we want to print out the name of the employee in our example
structure. 
<P>
Okay, so we know that our pointer is going to point to a structure
declared using struct tag. We declare such a pointer with the
declaration: 
<PRE>
    struct tag *st_ptr;
</PRE>
<P>
and we point it to our example structure with: 
<PRE>
    st_ptr = &amp;my_struct;
</PRE>
<P>
Now, we can access a given member by de-referencing the pointer.
But, how do we de-reference the pointer to a structure? Well,
consider the fact that we might want to use the pointer to set
the age of the employee. We would write: 
<PRE>
    (*st_ptr).age = 63;
</PRE>
<P>
Look at this carefully. It says, replace that within the parenthesis
with that which <B>st_ptr</B> points to, which is the structure
<B>my_struct</B>. Thus, this breaks down to the same as <B>my_struct.age</B>.
<P>
However, this is a fairly often used expression and the designers
of C have created an alternate syntax with the same meaning which
is: 
<PRE>
    st_ptr-&gt;age = 63;
</PRE>
<P>
With that in mind, look at the following program: 
<PRE>
------------ program 5.2 ---------------------

/* Program 5.2 from PTRTUT10.HTM   6/13/97 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct tag{                     /* the structure type */
    char lname[20];             /* last name */
    char fname[20];             /* first name */
    int age;                    /* age */
    float rate;                 /* e.g. 12.75 per hour */
};

struct tag my_struct;           /* define the structure */
void show_name(struct tag *p);  /* function prototype */

int main(void)
{
    struct tag *st_ptr;         /* a pointer to a structure */
    st_ptr = &amp;my_struct;        /* point the pointer to my_struct */
    strcpy(my_struct.lname,&quot;Jensen&quot;);
    strcpy(my_struct.fname,&quot;Ted&quot;);
    printf(&quot;\n%s &quot;,my_struct.fname);
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,my_struct.lname);
    my_struct.age = 63;
    show_name(st_ptr);          /* pass the pointer */
    return 0;
}

void show_name(struct tag *p)
{
    printf(&quot;\n%s &quot;, p-&gt;fname);  /* p points to a structure */
    printf(&quot;%s &quot;, p-&gt;lname);
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, p-&gt;age);
}

-------------------- end of program 5.2 ----------------

<P>
Again, this is a lot of information to absorb at one time. The
reader should compile and run the various code snippets and using
a debugger monitor things like<B> my_struct</B> and <B>p</B> while
single stepping through the main and following the code down into
the function to see what is happening. <BR>
