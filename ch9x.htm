<H2>CHAPTER 9: Pointers and Dynamic Allocation of Memory</H2>

    There are times when it is convenient to allocate memory at
run time using <B>malloc()</B>, <B>calloc()</B>, or other allocation functions.
Using this approach permits postponing the decision on the size
of the memory block need to store an array, for example, until
run time.  Or it permits using a section of memory for the
storage of an array of integers at one point in time, and then
when that memory is no longer needed it can be freed up for other
uses, such as the storage of an array of structures.

<P>

    When memory is allocated, the allocating function (such as
<B>malloc()</B>, <B>calloc()</B>, etc.) returns a pointer.  The type of this
pointer depends on whether you are using an older K&amp;R compiler or
the newer ANSI type compiler.  With the older compiler the type
of the returned pointer is <B>char</B>, with the ANSI compiler it is
<B>void</B>.

<P>

    If you are using an older compiler, and you want to allocate
memory for an array  of integers you will have to cast the char
pointer returned to an integer pointer.  For example, to allocate
space for 10 integers we might write:

<PRE>
    int *iptr;
    iptr = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    if (iptr == NULL)

    { .. ERROR ROUTINE GOES HERE .. }
</PRE>

    If you are using an ANSI compliant compiler, <B>malloc()</B> returns
a <B>void</B> pointer and since a void pointer can be assigned to a
pointer variable of any object type, the <B>(int *)</B> cast shown above
is not needed.  The array dimension can be determined at run time
and is not needed at compile time.  That is, the <B>10</B> above could
be a variable read in from a data file or keyboard, or calculated
based on some need, at run time.

<P>

    Because of the equivalence between array and pointer
notation, once <B>iptr</B> has been assigned as above, one can use the
array notation.  For example, one could write:

<PRE>
    int k;
    for (k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++)
       iptr[k] = 2;
</PRE>

to set the values of all elements to 2.

<P>

    Even with a reasonably good understanding of pointers and
arrays, one place the newcomer to C is likely to stumble at first
is in the dynamic allocation of multi-dimensional arrays.  In
general, we would like to be able to access elements of such
arrays using array notation, not pointer notation, wherever
possible. Depending on the application we may or may not know
both dimensions at compile time.  This leads to a variety of ways
to go about our task.

<P>

    As we have seen, when dynamically allocating a one
dimensional array its dimension can be determined at run time.
Now, when using dynamic allocation of higher order arrays, we
never need to know the first dimension at compile time.  Whether
we need to know the higher dimensions depends on how we go about
writing the code.  Here I will discuss various methods of
dynamically allocating room for 2 dimensional arrays of integers.

<P>

    First we will consider cases where the 2nd dimension is known
at compile time.

<H3>METHOD 1:</H3>

    One way of dealing with the problem is through the use of the
<B>typedef</B> keyword.  To allocate a 2 dimensional array of integers
recall that the following two notations result in the same object
code being generated:

<PRE>

    multi[row][col] = 1;     *(*(multi + row) + col) = 1;

</PRE>

    It is also true that the following two notations generate the
same code:

<PRE>

    multi[row]            *(multi + row)

</PRE>

    Since the one on the right must evaluate to a pointer, the
array notation on the left must also evaluate to a pointer.  In
fact <B>multi[0]</B> will return a pointer to the first integer in the
first row, <B>multi[1]</B> a pointer to the first integer of the second
row, etc.  Actually, <B>multi[n]</B> evaluates to a pointer to that
array of integers that make up the n-th row of our 2
dimensional array. That is, <B>multi</B> can be thought of as an array
of arrays and <B>multi[n]</B> as a pointer to the n-th array of this
array of arrays.  Here the word <B>pointer</B> is being used
to represent an address value.  While such usage is common in the
literature, when reading such statements one must be careful to
distinguish between the constant address of an array and a
variable pointer which is a data object in itself.

<P>

Consider now:

<PRE>

--------------- Program 9.1 --------------------------------

/* Program 9.1 from PTRTUT10.HTM  6/13/97 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#define COLS 5

typedef int RowArray[COLS];
RowArray *rptr;

int main(void)
{
    int nrows = 10;
    int row, col;
    rptr = malloc(nrows * COLS * sizeof(int));
    for (row = 0; row &lt; nrows; row++)
    {
        for (col = 0; col &lt; COLS; col++)
        {
            rptr[row][col] = 17;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
------------- End of Prog. 9.1 --------------------------------

</PRE>

    Here I have assumed an ANSI compiler so a cast on the void
pointer returned by <B>malloc()</B> is not required.  If you are using
an older K&amp;R compiler you will have to cast using:

<PRE>
    rptr = (RowArray *)malloc(.... etc.
</PRE>

    Using this approach,<B> rptr</B> has all the characteristics of an
array name name, (except that rptr is modifiable),  and array notation may be used throughout the rest of
the program.  That also means that if you intend to write a
function to modify the array contents, you must use COLS as a
part of the formal parameter in that function, just as we did
when discussing the passing of two dimensional arrays to a
function.



<H3>METHOD 2:</H3>

    In the METHOD 1 above, rptr turned out to be a pointer to
type &quot;one dimensional array of COLS integers&quot;.  It turns out that
there is syntax which can be used for this type without the need
of <B>typedef</B>.  If we write:

<PRE>

    int (*xptr)[COLS];

</PRE>

the variable <B>xptr</B> will have all the same characteristics as the
variable <B>rptr</B> in METHOD 1 above, and we need not use the
<B>typedef</B> keyword.  Here <B>xptr</B> is a pointer to an array of
integers and the size of that array is given by the <B>#defined
COLS</B>.  The parenthesis placement makes the pointer notation
predominate, even though the array notation has higher
precedence.  i.e. had we written

<PRE>
    int *xptr[COLS];
</PRE>

we would have defined <B>xptr</B> as an array of pointers holding the
number of pointers equal to that #defined by COLS.  That is not
the same thing at all.  However, arrays of pointers have their
use in the dynamic allocation of two dimensional arrays, as will
be seen in the next 2 methods.

<H3>METHOD 3:</H3>

   Consider the case where we do not know the number of elements
in each row at compile time, i.e. both the number of rows and
number of columns must be determined at run time.  One way of
doing this would be to create an array of pointers to type<B> int</B>
and then allocate space for each row and point these pointers at
each row.  Consider:

<PRE>

-------------- Program 9.2 ------------------------------------

/* Program 9.2 from PTRTUT10.HTM   6/13/97 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int nrows = 5;     /* Both nrows and ncols could be evaluated */
    int ncols = 10;    /* or read in at run time */
    int row;
    int **rowptr;
    rowptr = malloc(nrows * sizeof(int *));
    if (rowptr == NULL)
    {
        puts(&quot;\nFailure to allocate room for row pointers.\n&quot;);
        exit(0);
    }

    printf(&quot;\n\n\nIndex   Pointer(hex)   Pointer(dec)   Diff.(dec)&quot;);

    for (row = 0; row &lt; nrows; row++)
    {
        rowptr[row] = malloc(ncols * sizeof(int));
        if (rowptr[row] == NULL)
        {
            printf(&quot;\nFailure to allocate for row[%d]\n&quot;,row);
            exit(0);
        }
        printf(&quot;\n%d         %p         %d&quot;, row, rowptr[row], rowptr[row]);
        if (row &gt; 0)
        printf(&quot;              %d&quot;,(int)(rowptr[row] - rowptr[row-1]));
    }

    return 0;
}

--------------- End 9.2 ------------------------------------

</PRE>

    In the above code <B>rowptr</B> is a pointer to pointer to type<B> int</B>.
In this case it points to the first element of an array of
pointers to type <B>int</B>.  Consider the number of calls to<B> malloc()</B>:

<PRE>

    To get the array of pointers             1     call
    To get space for the rows                5     calls
                                          -----
                     Total                   6     calls
</PRE>

    If you choose to use this approach note that while you can
use the array notation to access individual elements of the
array, e.g.  <B>rowptr[row][col] = 17;</B>, it does not mean that the
data in the &quot;two dimensional array&quot; is contiguous in memory.

<P>

    You can, however, use the array notation just as if it were a
continuous block of memory.  For example, you can write:

<PRE>
    rowptr[row][col] = 176;
</PRE>

just as if rowptr were the name of a two dimensional array
created at compile time.  Of course<B> row</B> and <B>col</B> must be
within the bounds of the array you have created, just as with an
array created at compile time.

<P>

    If you want to have a contiguous block of memory
dedicated to the storage of the elements in the array you can do it as follows:

<H3>METHOD 4:</H3>

    In this method we allocate a block of memory to hold the
whole array first.  We then create an array of pointers to point
to each row.  Thus even though the array of pointers is being
used, the actual array in memory is contiguous.  The code looks
like this:

------------- End Program 9.3 -----------------

</PRE>

Consider again, the number of calls to malloc()

<PRE>
    To get room for the array itself      1      call
    To get room for the array of ptrs     1      call
                                        ----
                         Total            2      calls

</PRE>

    Now, each call to <B>malloc()</B> creates additional space overhead
since<B> malloc()</B> is generally implemented by the operating system
forming a linked list which contains data concerning the size of
the block.  But, more importantly, with large arrays (several
hundred rows) keeping track of what needs to be freed when the
time comes can be more cumbersome.  This, combined with the
contiguousness of the data block that permits initialization to
all zeroes using <B>memset()</B> would seem to make the second
alternative the preferred one.

<P>

    As a final example on multidimensional arrays we will
illustrate the dynamic allocation of a three dimensional array.
This example will illustrate one more thing to watch when doing
this kind of allocation.  For reasons cited above we will use the
approach outlined in alternative two.  Consider the following
code:

    /* first we set aside space for the array itself */

    space = malloc(X_DIM * Y_DIM * Z_DIM * sizeof(char));

    /* next we allocate space of an array of pointers, each
       to eventually point to the first element of a
       2 dimensional array of pointers to pointers */

    Arr3D = malloc(Z_DIM * sizeof(char **));

            printf(&quot;    diff = %d  &quot;,diff);
            printf(&quot; z = %d  y = %d\n&quot;, z, y);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

</PRE>

    If you have followed this tutorial up to this point you
should have no problem deciphering the above on the basis of the
comments alone.   There are a couple of points that should be made however.
Let's start with the line which reads:


<PRE>
    Arr3D[z][y] = space + (z*(X_DIM * Y_DIM) + y*X_DIM);
</PRE>

    Note that here <B>space</B> is a character pointer, which
is the same type as <B>Arr3D[z][y]</B>.    It is important that
when adding an integer, such as that obtained by evaluation of
the expression  <B>(z*(X_DIM * Y_DIM) + y*X_DIM)</B>, to a
pointer, the result is a new pointer value.  And when assigning 
pointer values to pointer variables the data types of the value and 
variable must match.
